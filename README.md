**Shrink Images** is a simple REST API written in Go for resizing and
optimizing images. Since it leverages the power of
[libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/), it should be quite fast
and memory efficient.

It is currently a work in progress, but it should be usable for the
basic use cases.
